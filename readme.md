# `wcs-workshop-registration`

A Google Sheets application (yes, really...) for partially automating the process of handling workshop registrations.

To use it, create a Google Form to gather the necessary information about the people registering, create a Google Sheet connected to the Form, and upload the script using Google's `clasp` tool.
